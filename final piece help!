FINISHED!!! 



alright guys....here is the deal. the major faults are ironed out. now, for the final piece of the puzzle.
i'm tired of looking at this for the last 8 hours so its up to you guys.

in the mastermind file we initialize the PASSWORD. this is then put into the while loop.
then the password is sent into the varifyguess function. within the varifyguess
function I change a local copy of the password. so basically password is copied into char array A.
I then modify the local copy A. this is where the magic gets funky, even though I have created 2 seperate instances
where the password is copied from its original source, the initial PASSWORD array gets changed as well!
this is no good. I need the password to be sent into varifyguess as the original eachtime, not the modified version that 
I make.

aka this is what happens

password is abcd
sent into varifyguess.
send to array A.
change array A from abcd to a..d
exit varifyguess.
boom, original password is now a..d. 

I need it to stay abcd each time its sent in!




the rest, just need cleaning up, and obvious de-bug println's taken out....


good luck ;)

Riley: alright so i added the classes to be all part of the same package because you can't import them if they aren't a package
and i'm pretty sure i fixed up the guess varify code but i'm trying to run it and having trouble...:( anyone else have any luck?

Annika:
FINISHED. Fixed all the last bugs and added in the masking for the console so the passcode doesn't appear
when entering it the first time.
